# get_next_line
<h1> Reading a line on a fd is way too tedious </h1>
<p>The goal of this project is to create a function that reads a file descriptor and returns a line</p>
<p>Calling your function get_next_line in a loop will then allow you to read the text
available on the file descriptor one line at a time until the end of it.</p>
